# Ciphers

Found an encrypted message in a video game, originally thought it was a simple letter shift. It wasn't. But I still wrote this because, why not? Allows user to input a message and number to use for shifting the letters. Can also be used to decrypt "Caeser Cipher" messages, by entering the opposite of the shift number.

The TK version is an attempt to do the same thing with Tkinter, but poorly.

--------------------

Discovered through the internets that the cypher itself was a Vigen√®re cipher. I figured why not try to make something for this cipher, too? Two new files, named clearly, one for creating an encrypted message, one for decrypting the message, assuming you have the key. I'm nowhere near smart enough to make an actual decryption program with no key present. Oh no.
