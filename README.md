# Caeser Cipher

Found an encrypted message in a video game, originally thought it was a simple letter shift. It wasn't. But I still wrote this because, why not? Allows user to input a message and number to use for shifting the letters. Can also be used to decrypt "Caeser Cipher" messages, by entering the opposite of the shift number.

The TK version is an attempt to do the same thing in Tkinter, but poorly.
